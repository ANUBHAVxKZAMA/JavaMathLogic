# Java Math Logic

A collection of basic to intermediate Java programs focusing on mathematical logic implementation using loops and conditional statements â€” no shortcuts, just raw logic.

## What's Inside

This repo includes Java programs for:

- Factorial Calculation
- Fibonacci Series (loop-based)
- HCF (Highest Common Factor)
- LCM (Least Common Multiple)
- Power using Loop (x^n)
- Square Root Check (Linear Search)
- Square Root Check (Binary Search)
- Prime Number Check

## Folder Structure

All programs are written in clean and beginner-friendly Java, with separate classes for each logic. You can compile and run them individually.

## Why This Repo?

This project is part of my core Java revision and logic-building practice before diving into full-stack development and competitive programming. All logic is hand-crafted, focused on learning and understanding how things work under the hood.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANUBHAVxKZAMA/JavaMathLogic.git

2. **Navigate to the folder and compile any Java file**:
3. **Run the compiled class**:
